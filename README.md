# Schematic-and-Layout-of-pPIM-architecture

- Generated the layout of pPIM architecture using a cadence environment. This project is part of one of the research papers and also the graduate paper for partial fulfillment of the master's degree. 
- Generated clean Core layout which consists of 8 LUTs( 256 MUX+LATCH), 8-bit Registers, and 8 Routers( 8*1 MUX).
- Layout is generated within the specified area with clean DRC and LVS.
- Furthermore, the layout for a cluster is also generated which consists of 9 cores laid down in a 3*3 manner.
- Layout area of a cluster: 0.011 mmÂ².
